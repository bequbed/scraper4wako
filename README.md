# scraper4wako

This project was created to offer Syncler's community scrapers for wako/Helios users. This is for private convenience and is not meant for the broader public.

You are solely responsible for the content you watch online, these scrapers do not offer any content, they merely aid to web search on publically available magnet hosts.

## How to use
Click on any of the txt files in this repo (only ONE), then right click on "Raw" and copy the URL. You will get a raw.githubusercontent.com URL, that is the provider URL you need to enter in Helios.

Have fun!
